# Terraform - GKE Cluster Deployment with Security Guardrails

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to deploy a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with custom networking, including two node pools, store Terraform state in a GCS bucket, and ensure all infrastructure deployments meet security standards using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Conftest.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. **Set Up VPC and Subnets**
```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "gke-vpc"
  auto_create_subnetworks = false
}

resource "google_compute_subnetwork" "subnet_a" {
  name          = "subnet-a"
  region        = "us-central1"
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name
  ip_cidr_range = "10.0.0.0/24"
}
```

### 2. **Create GKE Cluster with Node Pools**
```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "gke_cluster" {
  name     = "gke-cluster"
  location = "us-central1"
  network  = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name
  subnetwork = google_compute_subnetwork.subnet_a.name
}

resource "google_container_node_pool" "general_node_pool" {
  name     = "general-node-pool"
  cluster  = google_container_cluster.gke_cluster.name
  location = "us-central1"
  node_config { machine_type = "e2-medium" }
  initial_node_count = 2
}
```

### 3. **Store Terraform State in GCS Bucket**
```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "terraform_state_bucket" {
  name = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
  location = "US"
}
```
Run the following command to initialize Terraform with the GCS backend:
```bash
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=your-terraform-state-bucket" -backend-config="prefix=terraform/state"
```

### 4. **Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions**

Create `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`:
```yaml
name: Terraform CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Google Cloud SDK
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2
        with:
          project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          credentials: ${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS_JSON }}

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init -backend-config="bucket=${{ secrets.GCS_BUCKET_NAME }}" -backend-config="prefix=terraform/state"

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan

      - name: Terraform Apply
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Security & Automation Guardrails with OPA/Conftest

### 1. **Write a Conftest Policy for GCS Bucket Encryption & Project Restriction**

We need to ensure that all Terraform code includes encryption for GCS buckets and restricts the project. The following is a sample Conftest policy to check for these conditions.

#### **Conftest Policy (gcs-encryption.rego)**
```rego
package terraform.gcs

# Ensure that GCS bucket has encryption enabled
deny["GCS bucket encryption is not enabled"] {
  input.resource_type == "google_storage_bucket"
  not input.resource.values.encryption
}

# Restrict the project to a specific value
deny["Project is not allowed"] {
  input.resource_type == "google_project"
  input.resource.values.project_id != "your-allowed-project-id"
}
```

This policy checks two conditions:
- Ensures that GCS buckets are configured with encryption.
- Restricts the project ID to a specific allowed project.

### 2. **Running Conftest for Policy Validation**

To run Conftest and check if your Terraform code adheres to the policy, follow these steps:

1. Install Conftest if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    brew install conftest
    ```

2. Run Conftest against your Terraform files:
    ```bash
    conftest test path_to_your_terraform_files
    ```

This will evaluate your Terraform code based on the policy defined in `gcs-encryption.rego` and return any violations.

### Conclusion
- **Infrastructure**: This Terraform configuration sets up a VPC, GKE cluster with two node pools, and stores state in GCS.
- **Security Guardrails**: The Conftest policy ensures GCS bucket encryption and restricts the project ID.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions (TFActions) automates the deployment process.

This project ensures security compliance in Terraform deployments using OPA and Conftest while automating infrastructure deployment and management.

This README now includes the security guardrails with OPA/Conftest and describes how to ensure Terraform code meets security standards, alongside the previously provided instructions for deploying the GKE cluster with Terraform.
